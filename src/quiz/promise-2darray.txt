Explain the code execution based on the order of the messages logged in src/quiz/promise-2darray.txt.
The main problem with this code is that it doesn't properly wait for the Promise to be resolved or rejected, 
but instead prints the Promise object itself. When the sum2DArray function is called, 
it first prints out "Sum called..." To show the process of starting to calculate the sum. 
Next, it checks whether the passed argument is an array, and if it is, 
asynchronously computes the sum of the array by setTimeout, which results in "resolving..." 
The print is delayed until the next event loop. If the argument is not an array, print "rejecting..." immediately. 
And reject the Promise. In either case, "returning from sum" is printed immediately after checking the input, 
as it is part of the code to be executed simultaneously. 
The modified code solves the problem in the original code by using.then() and.catch() to handle promises correctly, 
ensuring that calculations or error messages are printed only after promises are resolved or rejected.
